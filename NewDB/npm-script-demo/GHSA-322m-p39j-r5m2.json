  "summary": "Malicious Package in npm-script-demo",
  "details": "The `npm-script-demo` package is a piece of malware that opens a connection to a command and control server and executed the instructions it is given.\n\nIt has been removed from the npm registry.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nAny computer that has this package installed or running should be considered fully compromised. All secrets and keys stored on that computer should be rotated immediately from a different computer.\n\nThe package should be removed, but as full control of the computer has been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the package will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it.",
