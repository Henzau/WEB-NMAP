  "summary": "Potential buffer overflow in psd-tools",
  "details": "### Impact\nAn issue was discovered in psd-tools before 1.9.4.\nThe Cython implementation of RLE decoding did not check for malformed PSD input data\nduring decoding to the PIL.Image or NumPy format, leading to a Buffer Overflow.\n\n### Patches\nUsers of psd-tools version v1.8.37 to v1.9.3 should upgrade to v1.9.4.\n\n### Workarounds\nWithout Cython present on installation, buffer overflow does not occur but IndexError will be thrown. However, already installed psd-tools with Cython extention should be upgraded.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/psd-tools/psd-tools/pull/198\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [psd-tools](https://github.com/psd-tools/psd-tools/issues)",
