  "summary": "CSV Injection in symfony/serializer",
  "details": "Description\n-----------\n\nCSV Injection, also known as Formula Injection, occurs when websites embed untrusted input inside CSV files. When a spreadsheet program opens a CSV, any cell starting with `=` is interpreted by the software as a formula and could be abused by an attacker.\n\nIn Symfony 4.1, we've added the opt-in `csv_escape_formulas` option in `CsvEncoder`, to prefix all cells starting by  `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` by a tab `\\t`. \n\nSince then, OWASP added 2 chars in that list: \n- Tab (0x09)\n- Carriage return (0x0D)\n\nThis makes our previous prefix char (Tab `\\t`) part of the vulnerable characters, and [OWASP suggests](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/CSV_Injection) using the single quote `'` for prefixing the value.\n\nResolution\n----------\n\nSymfony now follows the OWASP recommendations and use the single quote `'` to prefix formulas and adds the prefix to cells starting by `\\t`, `\\r` as well as `=`, `+`, `-` and `@`.\n\nThe patch for this issue is available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/3da6f2d45e7536ccb2a26f52fbaf340917e208a8) for branch 4.4.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nWe would like to thank Jake Barwell for reporting the issue and Jérémy Derussé for fixing the issue.\n",
