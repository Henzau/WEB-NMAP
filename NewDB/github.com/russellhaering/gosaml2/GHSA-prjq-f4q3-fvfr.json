  "summary": "gosaml2 is vulnerable to NULL Pointer Dereference",
  "details": "### Impact\nIn versions prior to v0.7.0 it was possible for an attacker to supply an invalid assertion which would trigger a panic due to a nil-pointer dereference.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue was patched in v0.7.0, released on March 2, 2022.\n\n### Workarounds\nCallers to `gosaml2` can use `recover()` to handle panics to mitigate a potential DoS.\n\n### References\nSee issue #59 for details.",
